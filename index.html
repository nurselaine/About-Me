        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p><br>
            Are we all not a sum of our parts? I guess experience has a bit to do with us all, especially in our formative years. I'm the youngest of 6 and the only boy. My father was also a veteran so not only did we travel a bunch, a third of my siblings were born outside the states extending my family even further. In a brief piece about my self, the first thing i do is speak of others. That should be very telling.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><br>
            I have made multiple stints in the collegiate realm. After i left the military I was a bit aimless, so i went with the expected route. A have accumulated more than an associates worth of credits over the years but as for a singular summation, that is the highest accolade ive attained.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p><br>
            I have been fortunate enough to have have my money, make more money. Since leaving the military I have continuously day traded on and off as well as engaging in other similar ventures. As of late ive been bartending but its something i will put down soon.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p><br>
            A goal of mine is to not have to do something like this again. This reads very much like a resume' and its unseamly to me. With coding, there should be very little subterfuge. There will always be standard practices, which sadly include resume building, but its one of the few industries that are alive. It is very show me what you can do, not tell me. That is exciting to me.
